### Existing Features

-   The landing page

    -   A greeting and a brief presentation of what the site is about. For a nautical ambiance, I chose the round and rich font of Spinnaker for the header.
    -   My logotype displaying my nickname Pat placed on top of the first letter of my surname. The design is my own, and the Spinnaker font is chosen to reflect my sailing passion. To save space, the logo is removed on small screens.
    -   An image of my design for the rig and sail plan to my pilot cutter.
    -   The landing page has a video background playing a soft wave motion that reflects my calm personality and further enhances the nautical vibe of the website.
    -   Amessage is diplayed to a user with a mobile device held in landscape mode, politely prompting to turn the device to portrait mode.

-   Navigation Bar
    -   Navigation links, My Projects, Myself, and My Reachability for quick and easy access to the different sections.
    -   A Scroll Down button linking to the Testimonials section.
    -   An Up To Top button for easy navigation to the landing page.
-   Testamonials
    -   A background of a nautical chart to keep the maritime ambiance.
    -   I have chosen to show my testimonials in a slideshow, which the user controls by clicking on either the left or the right button beneath the testimonials card. The dots in between the buttons will indicate which card is currently on display.
