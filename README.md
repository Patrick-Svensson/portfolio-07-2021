### Existing Features

<br>

-   The landing page

    -   A greeting and a brief presentation to give the user some information as to what the site is about. For a nautical ambiance, which is to show my keen interest in boats and sailing, I chose the round and rich font of Spinnaker for the header. To get the designer's perspective, the sections are incased in blueprint drawing frames.

    -   My logotype displaying my nickname Pat placed on top of the first letter of my surname. The design is my own, and the Spinnaker font is chosen to reflect my sailing passion. To save space, the logo is removed on small screens.

    -   An image of my design for the rig and sail plan to my pilot cutter.

    -   The landing page has a video background playing a soft wave motion that reflects my calm personality and further enhances the nautical vibe of the website.

    -   Amessage is diplayed to a user with a mobile device held in landscape mode, politely prompting to turn the device to portrait mode.

    -   A background of a nautical chart to keep the maritime ambiance.

-   My Projects Section

    -   Eight portholes, each showing a filtered image of a project with a heading that describes the main features of that particular project.

    -   When the user clicks on one of the portholes a modal will appear.

    -   The modal will display a heading with the name of the project, a small image, and a description of the project as well as links to the repository on GitHub, and to the project's site. The user can exit the modal by either clicking on the exit button at the top, or by clicking somewhere outside of the modal box.
